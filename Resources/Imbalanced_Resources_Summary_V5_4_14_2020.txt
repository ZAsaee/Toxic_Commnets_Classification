Some Resources on Imbalanced Classification Problems

==============================================================
The resources are listed in the order of complexity,
beginning with the less complex ones.

The first two resources are really good summaries, and the second 
contains examples and good graphical explanations. 

The third resource is a package that implements some 
resampling methods in Python.

For a good quick start, I would recommend to read
(1) for an overview, and then try some of the
methods mentioned there implemented by the
package in (3).

Also, bear in mind that for some applications, there
might be specific methods that work well for those
applications.

An example would be "image augmentation", or
"image augmentation for x-ray images". Do Web
searches of these topics if you want to have
an idea of how these methods work. Also, try
the more generic term "Data Augmentation".

(3.1) Good intro to SMOTE ...

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: if you are using Anaconda, I recommend
that you install imbalanced-learn from the Anaconda
prompt, as indicated here ...

https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html

conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn

**ADDITIONAL NOTE**: the author of (1) above has also
put together additional resources:

Discover how to systematically get good results for imbalanced classification:
>> Step-By-Step Framework for Imbalanced Classification Projects
https://machinelearningmastery.com/framework-for-imbalanced-classification-projects/

Discover how to work through a credit card fraud prediction project step-by-step:
>> Imbalanced Classification with the Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions Dataset
https://machinelearningmastery.com/imbalanced-classification-with-the-fraudulent-credit-card-transactions-dataset/

Discover how to identify glass type based on the chemical composition:
>> Imbalanced Multiclass Classification with the Glass Identification Dataset

**END NOTE**
==============================================================
Other resources come from one of the experts in the field, 
Prof. Chawla from Notre Dame.

He wrote a chapter for the book "Imbalanced Learning: Foundations, Algorithms,  and Applications, First Edition (2013)". This chapter can be
downloaded from here:

(4) https://www3.nd.edu/~dial/publications/hoens2013imbalanced.pdf

I think this chapter presents good brief explanations of the
different approaches for under-sampling and over-sampling.

He is the author of "SMOTE". You might want to see the following
in connection with that:

https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html

(5) It turns out that one of his graduate students 
(Reid Johnson) completed his PhD dissertation on precisely this topic. His dissertation can be downloaded from here ...

https://curate.nd.edu/downloads/0p096684s7g

(6) He also recently published a paper with other co-authors
applying some of these ideas to credit card data

https://www3.nd.edu/~rjohns15/content/papers/ssci2015_calibrating.pdf

(7) Finally, I am curious about whether applying "anomaly detection" algorithms
could be used as an unsupervised approach to "detect" anomalies, instead
of predicting them. We would simply ignore the labels and let the data "talk".

You can see several videos from Prof. Andrew Ng (Stanford)
on the topic, of which the one below is the firts one. 
I took this course on Coursera back in 2012, and really liked it.

I know it is a lot to chew on, so use these resources according to your needs.

Let me know if you have any questions.
